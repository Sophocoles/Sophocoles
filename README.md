ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcella Howard, an Informatics graduate from Arizona State University where I specialized in full-stack development and Geographic Information Science. With a strong foundation in data formatting and analysis, I've gained proficiency in key languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. Recently I have used React and Django in my development of the impactful StreetCard project, a solution aimed at connecting homeless individuals with their electronic health data. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect for potential collaborations. You can reach me at mnh1997@gmail.com or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcella-howard-615aa0102/).
